Ubuntu Image Fetcher 🌍➡️🖼️

A Python tool that embodies the Ubuntu philosophy ("I am because we are") by mindfully collecting and sharing images from the web community.

🌟 Embracing Ubuntu Principles

This project is more than just a technical script—it's an implementation of the Ubuntu philosophy:

· Community: Connects respectfully to servers across the global web community
· Respect: Handles errors gracefully and validates content before downloading
· Sharing: Organizes fetched images for later appreciation and sharing
· Practicality: Solves a real need while maintaining ethical practices

✨ Features

· Multiple URL Support: Process single or multiple image URLs at once
· Duplicate Prevention: Uses content hashing to avoid saving identical images
· Smart Filename Detection: Extracts filenames from URLs or HTTP headers
· Safety Checks: Validates content types and limits file sizes
· Graceful Error Handling: Provides clear, respectful error messages
· Community Respect: Uses proper headers and timeouts

============================================================
Welcome to the Ubuntu Image Fetcher
A tool for mindfully collecting images from the web
Embracing the principle: 'I am because we are'
============================================================

Please enter image URL(s), separated by commas if multiple: https://example.com/image1.jpg, https://example.com/image2.png

--- Processing URL 1 of 2 ---
Connecting to the community at example.com...
✓ Successfully fetched: image1.jpg
✓ Image saved to Fetched_Images/image1.jpg

--- Processing URL 2 of 2 ---
Connecting to the community at example.com...
✓ Successfully fetched: image2.png
✓ Image saved to Fetched_Images/image2.png

🔧 Technical Implementation

Key Functions:

· get_filename_from_url(): Extracts or generates appropriate filenames
· is_duplicate_image(): Prevents saving duplicate content using MD5 hashing
· download_image(): Handles the entire download process with error handling

Safety Features:

· Content-Type Validation: Ensures only images are downloaded
· File Size Limits: Prevents downloading excessively large files (10MB limit)
· URL Validation: Checks for properly formatted URLs
· Duplicate Detection: Avoids storing identical images multiple times

HTTP Headers Utilized:

· Content-Type: Verifies the response is an image
· Content-Length: Checks file size before processing
· Content-Disposition: Extracts filename information
· User-Agent: Identifies the tool respectfully to servers

🧪 Testing

The script handles various edge cases gracefully:

· Invalid URLs: Provides clear error messages
· Non-image content: Respectfully declines to download
· Network issues: Handles timeouts and connection errors
· Duplicate images: Preserves existing community resources
· Large files: Respects storage limits
